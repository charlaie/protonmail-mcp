# protonmail-mcp

An MCP server for using Proton Mail through the local Proton Mail Bridge. It exposes tools to list mailboxes, search message metadata, read allowed plain-text messages, and send plain-text email after user approval.

## Requirements

- Node.js with ESM support
- PNPM
- Proton Mail Bridge installed, running, and signed in
- Proton Bridge IMAP/SMTP credentials from the Bridge app

Use the Bridge app credentials, not your Proton account password.

## Install

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

The build output is written to `build/`. The executable entry point is `build/index.js`.

## Configure Proton Bridge

Copy the example environment file and fill in the Bridge values:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Required values:

```sh
PROTONMAIL_BRIDGE_USER=your-bridge-username
PROTONMAIL_BRIDGE_PASSWORD=your-bridge-password
```

Defaults match common Proton Bridge local settings:

```sh
PROTONMAIL_BRIDGE_HOST=127.0.0.1
PROTONMAIL_IMAP_PORT=1143
PROTONMAIL_SMTP_PORT=1025
PROTONMAIL_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=false
```

Optionally set `PROTONMAIL_MCP_POLICY_FILE` to choose where the read policy is stored. By default it uses `~/.config/protonmail-mcp/read-policy.json`.

## Set Up Read Policy

Before the MCP can search or read messages, configure the local read allowlist:

```sh
pnpm setup
```

The setup command lists Bridge mailboxes and asks which mailboxes the model may search and read. You can also restrict reads by sender email or sender domain.

Useful policy commands:

```sh
pnpm policy
pnpm reset-policy
pnpm policy:check
```


## Configure an MCP Client

Build the project first, then point your MCP client at `build/index.js`.

Example JSON:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "protonmail": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/Path/To/Repo/protonmail-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "PROTONMAIL_BRIDGE_USER": "your-bridge-username",
        "PROTONMAIL_BRIDGE_PASSWORD": "your-bridge-password",
        "PROTONMAIL_BRIDGE_HOST": "127.0.0.1",
        "PROTONMAIL_IMAP_PORT": "1143",
        "PROTONMAIL_SMTP_PORT": "1025",
        "PROTONMAIL_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If your MCP client starts servers from the repository directory, you can also use a `.env` file. For clients that start from another working directory, pass environment variables explicitly as shown above.

## Available MCP Tools

- `list_mailboxes`: lists Proton Bridge IMAP mailboxes and whether each is allowed by the read policy.
- `search_messages`: searches allowed mailboxes and returns message summaries only.
- `get_message`: reads one allowed message by mailbox and UID as parsed plain text. HTML and attachments are not returned.
- `send_email`: sends a plain-text email through Proton Bridge SMTP. The server requests mandatory user approval before delivery.
